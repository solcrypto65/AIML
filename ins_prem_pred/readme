This model is for predicting health insurance premium, using Linear Regression from sklearn library

Data file (insurance.csv) is from Kagle competition
Number of records - 1339.

Features :
	age -				numeric
	sex - 			categoric (male / female)
	bmi - 			numeric
	children - 		numeric
	smoker - 		categoric (yes / no)
	region - 		categoric (4 unique vaalues)

Target :
	charges - numeric

Understanding Data
	1. There are no null values in any of the column
	2. age ranges from 18 to 64
	3. bmi ranges from 15.96 to 53.13
	4. children ranges from 0 to 5
	5. there are no outliers in the data

Feature Engineering
	1. scale age, bmi, children between 0 to 1 using minmax scaler from sklearn
	2. change value of sex column to numeric, 0 = male, 1 = female
	3. change value of smoker column to numeric, 0 = yes, 1 = no
	4. do one hot encoding for region 


Model Accuracy
	1. Root Mean Square Error is 113067.54
	2. Model accuracy is 74.31
